This is the new version of my homepage. It's powered by the incredible Jekyll static site generator and having been a Wordpress devotee for the longest time it makes a refreshing change. Plus it runs in Ruby, my language of choice.


There is nothing to see here at the moment. I'll get around to resuming blogging in good time, but right now I'm too busy to make the commitment to doing it right.
