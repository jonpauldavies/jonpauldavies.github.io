<h2 style="color:#74ad87;">Profile </h2>
I'm a Liverpool UK based software professional with 20+ years experience of making computers do the right thing, resulting in a trail of happy customers across the globe.<br/><br/>

As an entrepreneur I'm a veteran of several successful start-up exits and work with many start-ups on an advisory basis.<br/><br/>

I am lucky enough to be a founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for <a href="http://www.disketteideas.com">Diskette</a>. 
  
Diskette is uncovering new ways of bringing software products to market. By combining a dedicated, expert,  in-house software team with a unique idea validation process, Diskette pops out fully formed micro-businesses ready for the world to enjoy. Diskette is a 'brain trust' that removes the guesswork out of the product creation and customer acquisition processes.<br/><br/>
  
In the past I've founded and successfully exited some other software businesses including Cassette, Qivox and Wranx.<br/><br/>

Systems I've personally delivered are used by 10 million UK customers on a daily basis, so building the 'big stuff' is something I am experienced in.<br/><br/>

I've also worked as the senior technical resource in a sales team that has landed multi-millions in sales in the past year. Again, the big projects are not things I shy away from!<br/><br/>

<h2 style="color:#74ad87;">Skills </h2>

My skills include software development, large scale systems architecture, team management, agile processes, presentation, mentoring, board-level management, strategy and acting as a technical sales wing-man. My role at Wranx requires me to:
