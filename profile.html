<h2 style="color:#74ad87;">Profile </h2>
I'm a Liverpool UK based software entrepreneur with 25+ years experience of making computers do the right thing, resulting in a trail of happy customers across the globe.<br/><br/>

I'm a veteran of several successful start-up exits and work with many start-ups on an advisory basis.<br/><br/>

I help many young startups to define their ideas and offering, create early product and, most importantly, land the first few paying clients.<br/><br/>

I am a founder, along with the inimitable Phil Simmonds, of <a href="http://www.disketteideas.com">Diskette</a>.

Diskette is uncovering new ways of bringing software products to market. By combining a dedicated, expert, in-house software team with a unique idea validation process, Diskette pops out fully formed micro-businesses ready for the world to enjoy. Diskette is a 'brain trust' that removes the guesswork out of the product creation and customer acquisition processes.<br/><br/>

In the past I've founded and successfully sold and exited other software businesses including Cassette, Qivox and Wranx.<br/><br/>

Systems I've personally delivered are used by 10 million UK customers on a daily basis, so building the 'big stuff' is something I am experienced in.<br/><br/>

I've also worked as the senior technical resource in a sales team that has landed multi-millions in sales in the past year. Again, the big projects are not things I shy away from!<br/><br/>

I also do quite a bit of public speaking, on the topics of behavioural science, society and work.<br/><br/>

<h2 style="color:#74ad87;">Skills </h2>

My skills include strategic leadership, behavioural science, futurology, design systems, agile processes, presentation and public speaking, mentoring, board-level advisory and good old fashioned sales.

I code too, mainly just for fun nowadays, to a high level in Ruby on Rails. I'm also a Microsoft MCPD, MCTS and MCP.<br/><br/>

<h2 style="color:#74ad87;">Fun </h2>

For fun I code, run, make music and hang out with my friends and family. I've also got some good stories from my days as a professional record producer - buy me a beer if you want to find out more!
