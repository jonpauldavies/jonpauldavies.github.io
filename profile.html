<h2 style="color:#74ad87;">Profile </h2>
I'm a Liverpool UK based software professional with 20+ years experience of making computers do the right thing, resulting in a trail of happy customers across the globe.<br/><br/>

As an entrepreneur I'm a veteran of several successful start-up exits and work with many start-ups on an advisory basis.<br/><br/>

I am lucky enough to be a founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for <a href="http://www.wranx.com">Wranx</a>. Wranx provides a continual training and assessment app to help HR and Learning and Development professionals extend their training and communication strategies out of the classroom and office. It does this by delivering continual, ongoing training and assessment direct to any employee desktop, tablet or smartphone. It uses scientifically proven advanced learning techniques like Spaced Repetition and the 70/20/10 model to deliver better results than any other methodology. <br/><br/>

Systems I've personally delivered are used by 10 million UK customers on a daily basis, so building the 'big stuff' is something I am experienced in.<br/><br/>

I've also worked as the senior technical resource in a sales team that has landed Â£35m in sales in the past year. Again, the big projects are not things I shy away from!<br/><br/>

<h2 style="color:#74ad87;">Skills </h2>
